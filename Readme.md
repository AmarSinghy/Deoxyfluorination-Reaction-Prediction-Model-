# Deoxyfluorination Reaction Prediction Model

## Overview

This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict high-yielding conditions for deoxyfluorination reactions. The work was guided by Prof. Debabrata Maiti in September 2022. The model utilizes a Random Forest algorithm to analyze reaction data and predict yields for new substrates with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) ranging from 8% to 13%.

## Features

- **Machine Learning for Reaction Prediction**: Developed a Random Forest model to predict the yield of deoxyfluorination reactions.
- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved a 7.4% RMSE accuracy on a dataset comprising 640 diverse reactions.
- **Python-Based Implementation**: Leveraged Python for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- **Effective Yield Prediction**: The model effectively predicts yields for new substrates, demonstrating RMSE accuracy between 8% and 13%.
